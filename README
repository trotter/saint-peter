As Saint Peter guards heaven's gate, so does saint-peter decide who goes where
in your rack based application.

saint-peter is a rack adapter and associated server that provides role based
authentication to rack based applications. It is *very* alpha right now, but I
am willing to make it more robust if people like the idea.

To see an example of it in action, pull down the code and run "ruby
examples/example.rb". This will start both a test "app" server and the
saint-peter server, then fire requests at them. Have a look and let me know
what you think.
